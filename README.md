# Masterduel TLDR overlay
Program that uses OCR to add an overlay to cards in Yu Gi Oh Masterduel.
The overlay are icons that represent card effects like negates so that unexperienced players can play the game without having to scroll through walls of text.

Partially incomplete, I just need to finish the Overlay icons module and connect the interface.

It features an elaborate 2-layer cache system to avoid spamming API calls or disk reads.

# TODOs
- [X] UI module
- [ ] Add searchers/milling tooltips
- [ ] Integrate interface
- [ ] Add features to interface (change properties)

# Possible improvements
- [ ] Take card type into account for internals (branch)
- [ ] Localization and language support
- [ ] Try reading memory process (later)
